We are a group of researchers at the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), and would like to invite you to participate in a pilot exercise on the use of experts to improve early warning predictions of conflict escalation.

The survey involves drawing on a map where you believe violent conflicts are likely to escalate or de-escalate during 2020. You have been assigned to a (few) country project(s), based on your academic or professional focus. For the purpose of this study, we need you to submit your predictions within the end of 2019.

It does not take long time to submit your predictions (approx. 10-15 minutes per country).

If you would like to participate, please follow the link below. The link takes you to a web-application where you can read more about the project, and share your conflict-risk predictions for 2020.

The survey is done as part of the EU-LISTCO project, which is funded under the Horizon 2020 EU programme. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask us, either using conflictcartographer@prio.org, or any of our emails (see below).

Best,
the conflict cartographer team at PRIO
