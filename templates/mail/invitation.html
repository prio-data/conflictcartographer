   We are a group of researchers at the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), and 
   <b>would like to invite you to participate in a pilot exercise</b> 
   on the use of experts to improve early warning predictions of conflict escalation.
</p></span>

<span><p>
{% if status == "drawn" %}

Thank you for your contribution so far. If you would like to add even more
predictions, go to the link below.

{% elif status == "registered" %}

You have not yet added any data in the application. If you have questions about
how to use the tool, or about how your data is handled, do not hesitate to get
in touch using one of the email addresses below. Your expertise and experience
is valuable, and would make an important contribution to the dataset in
production. Please follow the link below if you would like to add your
predictions.

{% elif status == "opened" or status == "reached" %}

You have not yet registered to participate. Please consider that your expertise
and experience would make a valuable contribution to the dataset, and thereby
to research on conflict prediction and prevention. If you would still like to
join the effort, follow the link below.

{% else %}

You have been chosen because you have country or regional expertise on the
countries that we are working on.

{% endif %}

<span><p>
If you take part, you will draw on a map where you believe violent conflicts are likely to escalate or de-escalate during 2020. You have been assigned to a (few) country project(s), based on your academic or professional focus. 
<b>For the purpose of this study, we need you to submit your predictions within the end of 2019.</b>
</p></span>

<span><p>It does not take long to submit your predictions (approx. 10-15 minutes per country).</p></span>

<span><p>We will provide participants with individual reports of their predictive performance relative to other participants and to machine models when data for 2020 has arrived.</p></span>

<span><p>If you would like to participate, please follow the link below. The link takes you to a web-application where you can read more about the project, and share your conflict-risk predictions for 2020. You will be prompted to create a password the first time you access the application.</p></span>

<span><p>We highly appreciate your participation</p></span>
