   We are a group of researchers at the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), and 
   <b>would like to invite you to participate in a pilot exercise</b> 
   on the use of experts to improve early warning predictions of conflict escalation.
</p></span>

<span><p>You have been chosen because you have country or regional expertise on the countries that we are working on.</p></span>

<span><p>
If you take part, you will draw on a map where you believe violent conflicts are likely to escalate or de-escalate during 2020. You have been assigned to a (few) country project(s), based on your academic or professional focus. 
<b>For the purpose of this study, we need you to submit your predictions within the end of 2019.</b>
</p></span>

<span><p>It does not take long to submit your predictions (approx. 10-15 minutes per country).</p></span>

<span><p>We will provide participants with individual reports of their predictive performance relative to other participants and to machine models when data for 2020 has arrived.</p></span>

<span><p>If you would like to participate, please follow the link below. The link takes you to a web-application where you can read more about the project, and share your conflict-risk predictions for 2020. You will be prompted to create a password the first time you access the application.</p></span>

<span><p>The survey is done as part of the EU-LISTCO project, which is funded under the Horizon 2020 EU programme. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask us, either using conflictcartographer@prio.org, or any of our emails (see below). </p></span>

<span><p>We highly appreciate your participation</p></span>
